## if even further gr labels required, copy/paste and edit contents. the max integer is 9
## the contents must obey the MIP's controlled vocabulary.
## for data in Greenlandic and Antarctic regrions, add 'a' or 'g' to the end of the grid_label
## for data that's been zonally averaged, add 'z' to the end of the grid label.
## no grid label can have more than one of 'a', 'g', or 'z' appended to the end
