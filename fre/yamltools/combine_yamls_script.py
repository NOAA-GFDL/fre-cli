"""
YAML Combination Utilities for FRE
----------------------------------

This module provides utility functions for combining model, experiment, compile, platform, and analysis
YAML files into unified configurations for the Flexible Runtime Environment (FRE) workflow. It offers routines
to consolidate YAMLs for CMORization, compilation, and post-processing, supporting both command-line tools
and internal workflow automation.

There are only four functions currently, with `consolidate_yamls` acting as the center of this file's control-flow. 
The other functions are called within `consolidate_yamls`, based on the `use` argument passed to it. `use` may be 
one of `cmor`, `pp`, and `compile` at this time, and determines which pieces of information are needed, where they 
come from, and where they are placed in the output dictionary. 

For every possible `use` argument currently accepted by `consolidate_yamls`, there exists a corresponding 
`info_parser` class that houses the specific requirements of the combination and the implementation as well.
For more information, consult the docstrings in those functions and modules, as well as those in this file.
