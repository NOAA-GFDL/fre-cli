`fre-cli` is the Flexible Runtime Environment (`FRE`) command-line interface (`CLI`). `fre-cli` aims to gives users intuitive and 
easy-to-understand access to both newly developed, and legacy `FRE` tools via a `click`-driven CLI, delivered as a `conda` package.



## **Intro**
`fre-cli` is a modern, user-friendly `conda` package that allows users to call `FRE` commands via a pythonic `Click`-based interface 
in a **_fre_** **tool** **_subtool_** style syntax. To learn more about what that means, read the graphic below or watch the following
sample video in this section

## **How to get Started**
Pick your entry-point to using `fre-cli` based on your requirements and needs. `fre-cli` is a `conda` package, and so requires
`conda` or `miniforge` (alias'd to `conda`) nearby.


### Method 1 - user-approach, Personal Conda Environment via conda channel/package
If you're a user not at GFDL, already have `conda`, and want a `fre-cli` that's ready-to-go out-of-the-box, simply do:
```
conda create --name fre --channel noaa-gfdl --channel conda-forge fre-cli
```

If you wish to specify aversion:
```
conda create --name fre-202501 --channel noaa-gfdl --channel conda-forge fre-cli::2025.01
```


### Method 2 - developer-approach, Personal Conda Environment via repo clone
Developers should have a full personal environment (without `fre-cli`) and use a locally `pip`-installed copy of the code. This 
enables full-featured usage of the software, equivalent to that of Method 1, but with the flexibility of being able to reliably 
`pip` install a local copy of the code.

This approach can be used both in and outside of GFDL. The only difference is how one accesses `conda` commands
```
# make sure conda is available / in your PATH variable
# if you are at gfdl, access conda via Lmod / miniforge module
module load miniforge

# Append necessary channels- fre-cli needs only these two channels and no others to build.
# it's possible depending on your conda installation that additional configuration steps are needed
conda config --append channels noaa-gfdl
conda config --append channels conda-forge

# grab a copy of the code from github and cd into the repository directory
git clone --recursive https://github.com/noaa-gfdl/fre-cli.git
cd fre-cli

# to avoid being prompted for confirmation, add '-y' to the call
# this downloads/builds fre-cli's dependecies ONLY
conda env create -f environment.yml

# activate the environment you just created.
# fre-cli isn't installed yet though, ONLY dependencies
# if you changed the name of the build environment, activate that name instead of fre-cli
conda activate fre-cli

# add mkmf to your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:${PWD}/mkmf/bin

# now we pip install the local code under the `fre/` directory
# the -e flag makes re-installing the code after editing not necessary
pip install -e .
```


### Method 3 - a User on GFDL systems (e.g. PPAN, Gaea), with `Lmod`
If you do not wish to interface with `conda` at all, but desire access to `fre` commands, simply execute `module load fre/2025.01`,
and you're ready to go. This is the simplest way to access `fre-cli` at GFDL, but does not easily facillitate `fre-cli` development.


### Method 4 - a User at GFDL, via Conda Environment Activation
If you want to hit the ground running, but have some flexibility being able to utilize local python code with `fre-cli` environment, 
this option can work for you. Developers can also utilize this approach for rapid-prototyping, but it's reccomended to switch to 
Method 1 for finalizing contributions.

- GFDL Workstation:
```
    module load miniforge
    conda activate /nbhome/fms/conda/envs/fre-cli
```
- Gaea:
```
    module use /usw/conda/modulefiles
    module load miniforge
    conda activate /ncrc/home2/Flexible.Modeling.System/conda/envs/fre-cli
```


## New Release Versioning Procedure 

- [ ] 1. Update the package release number (i.e. reported by `fre --version`) in your PR branch before merging to `main`
  - [ ] edit `version` in setup.py
  - [ ] edit two version mentions in fre/tests/test_fre_cli.py

- [ ] 2. Create tag in fre-cli (this repository) and associated github release
  - [ ] locally this can be done with `git tag -a <release>` and `git push --tags`
  - [ ] [observe the tagged release here](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli/releases)

- [ ] 3. Create corresponding tag in [fre-workflows](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fre-workflows/tags)

- [ ] 4. Observe new conda package deployed to [noaa-gfdl channel](https://anaconda.org/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli)



## GFDL deployment notes
Presently, all PRs accepted for merging to `main` trigger a conda-package deployment to the 
[`noaa-gfdl` channel](https://anaconda.org/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli), with the latest package version. 

### Latest available release (`fre/test`)
GFDL and gaea's `fre-cli` is re-built and re-installed as a conda environment/package every night at midnight into the `fms` user spaces.
```
# at GFDL or gaea, access with Lmod
module load fre/test

# at gaea, access with conda activation
conda activate /ncrc/home/fms/conda/envs/fre-test

# at GFDL, access with conda activation
conda activate /nbhome/fms/conda/envs/fre-test
```

### Major releases (`fre/2025.NN`)
These deployments are currently hand-installed in the `fms` user directories.
```
# at GFDL or gaea, access with Lmod
module load fre/2025.NN

# at gaea, access with conda activation
conda activate /ncrc/home/fms/conda/envs/fre-2025.NN

# at GFDL, access with conda activation
conda activate /nbhome/fms/conda/envs/fre-2025.NN
```



### Patch releases (`fre/2025.NN.PP`)
These deployments are hand-installed to the same major-release location, overwriting them. 
```
# at GFDL or gaea, access with Lmod
module load fre/2025.NN

# at gaea, access with conda activation
conda activate /ncrc/home/fms/conda/envs/fre-2025.NN

# at GFDL, access with conda activation
conda activate /nbhome/fms/conda/envs/fre-2025.NN
```

### Which `fre` version do I have?
You can always check the specific version, down to the patch-release space, with 
```
$ ] fre --version
fre, version 2025.NN.PP
```
