To create the compile yaml, reference the compile section on an XML. Certain fields should be included under "compile". These include ``experiment``, ``container_addlibs``, ``baremetal_linkerflags``, and ``src``.

The experiment can be explicitly defined or can be used in conjunction with defined ``fre_properties`` from the model yaml, as seen in the code block below

The compile yaml can follow the below structure:

.. code-block:: 

   compile: 
     experiment: !join [*group_version, "_compile"]
     container_addlibs: "list of libraries and packages needed for linking in container" (string)
     baremetal_linkerflags: "list of linker flags of libraries and packages needed"      (array with string elements)
     src: (information about each component)
       - component: "component name"                                                     (string)
         requires: ["list of components that this component depends on"]                 (list of string)
         repo: "url of code repository"                                                  (string)
         branch: "version of code to clone"                                              (string / list of strings)
         paths: ["paths in the component to compile"]                                    (list of strings)
         cppdefs: "CPPDEFS ot include in compiling componenet                            (string)
         makeOverrides: "overrides openmp target for MOM6"                               ('OPENMP=""') (string)
         otherFlags: "Include flags needed to retrieve other necessary code"             (string)
         doF90Cpp: True if the preprocessor needs to be run                              (boolean) 
         additionalInstructions: additional instructions to run after checkout           (string)
