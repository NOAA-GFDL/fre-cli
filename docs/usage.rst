``fre``
=======

Brief rundown of commands also provided below:

* Enter commands and follow ``--help`` messages for guidance 
* If the user just runs ``fre``, it will list all the command groups following ``fre``, such as
  ``run``, ``make``, ``pp``, etc. and once the user specifies a command group, the list of available
  subcommands for that group will be shown
* Commands that require arguments to run will alert user about missing arguments, and will also list
  the rest of the optional parameters if ``--help`` is executed
* Argument flags are not positional, can be specified in any order as long as they are specified
* Can run directly from any directory, no need to clone repository
* May need to deactivate environment and reactivate it in order for changes to apply
* ``fre/setup.py`` allows ``fre/fre.py`` to be ran as ``fre`` on the command line by defining it as an
  *entry point*. Without it, the call would be instead, something like ``python fre/fre.py``
