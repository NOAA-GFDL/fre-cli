=============
Usage
=============
Using a set of YAML configuration files, ``fre make`` compiles a FMS-based model, and ``fre pp`` postprocesses the history output and runs diagnostic analysis scripts. Please note that model running is not yet supported in FRE 2025; continue to use FRE Bronx frerun.

YAML Framework
========================
In order to utilize these FRE tools, a distrubuted YAML structure is required. This framework includes a main model yaml, a compile yaml, a platforms yaml, and post-processing yamls. Throughout the compilation and post-processing steps, combined yamls that will be parsed for information are created. Yamls follow a dictionary-like structure with ``[key]: [value]`` fields.
